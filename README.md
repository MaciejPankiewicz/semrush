# Prepare three test cases for each of the following scenarios (choose the "most interesting" cases, in your opinion):

    Searching for the word "semrush" on bing.com, filtered by content category (everything, video, news, etc.).
    Searching for the word "prowly" on google.com, filtered by date.


    Prepare test scenarios in English and in Gherkin syntax.
    Write the scenarios in a way that allows other testers on the team to easily update them.
    Illustrate the progress of your work by "committing" changes to a Git code repository periodically.
    Optionally, you may write simple test automation using a tool you are familiar with.

# Automatic tests work only on the Scenario: Search for a keyword and apply a content filter.
